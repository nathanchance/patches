Subject: [PATCH 09/16] FROMLIST: KVM: arm64: sys_regs: disable
 -Wuninitialized-const-pointer warning

A new warning in Clang 22 [1] complains that @clidr passed to
get_clidr_el1() is an uninitialized const pointer. get_clidr_el1()
doesn't really care since it casts away the const-ness anyways -- it is
a false positive.

|  ../arch/arm64/kvm/sys_regs.c:2978:23: warning: variable 'clidr' is uninitialized when passed as a const pointer argument here [-Wuninitialized-const-pointer]
|   2978 |         get_clidr_el1(NULL, &clidr); /* Ugly... */
|        |                              ^~~~~

Disable this warning for sys_regs.o with an iron fist as it doesn't make
sense to waste maintainer's time or potentially break builds by
backporting large changelists from 6.2+.

This patch isn't needed for anything past 6.1 as this code section was
reworked in Commit 7af0c2534f4c ("KVM: arm64: Normalize cache
configuration").

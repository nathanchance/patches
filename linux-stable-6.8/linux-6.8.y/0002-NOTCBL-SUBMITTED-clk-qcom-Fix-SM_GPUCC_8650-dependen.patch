Subject: [PATCH 02/12] NOTCBL: SUBMITTED: clk: qcom: Fix SM_GPUCC_8650
 dependencies

CONFIG_SM_GCC_8650 depends on ARM64 but it is selected by
CONFIG_SM_GPUCC_8650, which can be selected on ARM, resulting in a
Kconfig warning.

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SM_GCC_8650
  Depends on [n]: COMMON_CLK [=y] && COMMON_CLK_QCOM [=y] && (ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST [=n])
  Selected by [y]:
  - SM_GPUCC_8650 [=y] && COMMON_CLK [=y] && COMMON_CLK_QCOM [=y]

Add the same dependencies to CONFIG_SM_GPUCC_8650 to resolve the
warning.

Fixes: 8676fd4f3874 ("clk: qcom: add the SM8650 GPU Clock Controller driver")

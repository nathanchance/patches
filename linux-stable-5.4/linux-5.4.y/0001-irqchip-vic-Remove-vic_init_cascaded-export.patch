Subject: [PATCH 01/29] irqchip/vic: Remove vic_init_cascaded() export

  Section mismatch in reference from the variable __ksymtab_vic_init_cascaded to the function .init.text:vic_init_cascaded()

This was "fixed" by commit adf4f9d49c74 ("irqchip/vic: Drop cascaded
intialization call") but that is not suitable for stable.
